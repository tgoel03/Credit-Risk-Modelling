# Credit-Risk-Modelling
This project focuses on credit risk assessment using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains information about customers, including various features related to their financial behavior, and a label indicating whether they are classified as low risk (0) or high risk (1) for credit.

### Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can effectively classify customers into low-risk and high-risk categories based on their financial attributes. This model can assist financial institutions in making informed decisions regarding lending and credit approvals.

### Approach:

#### Data Exploration and Visualization:
1. Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. Visualization of data distribution and class balance to identify any imbalance issues.
3. Correlation analysis to understand the relationships between different features.

#### Data Preprocessing:
1. Handling missing data by replacing it with the mean value of the respective columns.
2. Handling imbalance in the dataset using oversampling techniques, specifically Random Over Sampling.
3. Model Development:

#### Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
1. Building a Random Forest Regressor model for classification, which is known for its robustness and effectiveness in handling complex datasets.
2. Training the model on the training set and making predictions on the test set.

#### Model Evaluation:
1. Evaluation of the model performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
2. Visualizing the confusion matrix to understand the model's performance in classifying low-risk and high-risk customers.

#### Conclusion:
1. Summarizing the findings and discussing the effectiveness of the developed model in credit risk assessment.
2. Providing insights and recommendations based on the model's performance for potential use by financial institutions.
